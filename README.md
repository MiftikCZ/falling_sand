## how to run
- You should have raylib library already installed along with c++ building tools.
- To build, run `make`.
- Then run the "out" executable using `./out`.
- I have tested this only on linux, so don't know if it works on other operating systems.

## controls
- Use your left mouse click to place blocks, and right mouse click to remove blocks.
- Use Q, W, E keys to change between materials.
